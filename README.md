# AOE_data_analysis

I analyzed 233716 Age of Empires 2 games and these are some of the insights - 
Go to the colab notebook to view the graphs, as some of the interactive graphs are not visible on github. 

1. Arabia is the most popular map, followed by Arena and Megarandom. 
2. The most common pick for civilization is mongols (probably due to the faster hunt), followed by Franks (probably because this is the default civilization). 
3. All civilizations have win rates close to 50%. Kudos to Microsoft at keeping the game fairly balanced. 
4. Player ratings follows a normal distribution, like most things in life. With the average player ELO ~ 1000. 
5. The most common civilization matchup is Mongols vs Mongols, played 1066 times in the games analyzed. There are 45 civilizations for players to choose from. 

6. The heighest win rate was 89.88%, by a player who won 80 games from a total of 89 games played. We don't have the player names in the data. 
7. The most played civilization by a single player was byzantines. Played a total of 169 times. 
8. Maps can favour certain civilizations with certain bonuses. Here is the best performing civilization (based on win rate) by each map. Example - Vikings on Acropolis win 56.52% of all games. 
9. The average length of a game was 51.79 minutes on black forest (slowest), compared to the 38.32 minutes on lowland (fastest).
